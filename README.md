# Asynchrony and Promises
This repository includes a hands-on exercise on using asynchronous functions (setTimeout(), setInterval()), as well as methods of the Promise class.

## Tasks

1. **Color switch.**
It starts changing the background color after pressing the ```start``` button with a certain frequency and ends after pressing the ```stop``` button..
2. **Countdown timer**
We use the __*flatpickr*__ and __*notiflix*__ library. We select the desired date in the future and press the ```start``` button, the timer begins counting down to today.
3. **promise generator**
The HTML contains form markup in the fields of which the user will enter the first delay in milliseconds, the step to increase the delay for each promise after the first, and the number of promises that need to be created.
4. **Digital clock**
Using the function __*setInterval()*__ and __*Date*__ we have created three types of watches, electronic with the day of the week, month and year, regular electronic and dial watches.
